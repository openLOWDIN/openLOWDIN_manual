openLOWDIN is a computational program that implements the Any Particle Molecular Orbital (APMO) method to study systems containing any type and number of quantum species, such as electrons, positrons, quantum nuclei, muons, or drude oscillators.

What can we do in Lowdin? The current version of the code encompasses the following quantum chemistry methods:

* HF
* DFT
* MP2
* CI (CIS, CISD, CIST, CISDTQ, FCI, CIPSI)
* PT (PT2, PT3, PP3, RENPP3, OVGF)
* NOCI

Check more details in the :ref:`Theory` and :ref:`Tutorials`

At present, openLOWDIN code is publicly available at https://github.com/efposadac/openLOWDIN
