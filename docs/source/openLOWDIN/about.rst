About
=====

openLOWDIN is a computational program that implements the Any Particle Molecular Orbital (APMO) method to study systems containing any type and number of quantum species, such as electrons, positrons, quantum nuclei, muons, or drude oscillators.

At present, openLOWDIN code is publicly available at https://github.com/efposadac/openLOWDIN

Capabilities
============

What can we do in Lowdin? The current version of the code encompasses the following quantum chemistry methods:

* HF
* DFT
* MP2
* CI (CIS, CISD, CIST, CISDTQ, FCI, CIPSI)
* PT (PT2, PT3, PP3, RENPP3, OVGF)
* NOCI

Check more details in the :ref:`Code` and :ref:`Tutorials`

Documentation
=============

The online manual of openLOWDIN is available at https://github.com/openLOWDIN/openLOWDIN_manual

This code results from an evolution of the APMO and LOWDIN software packages, both mainly developed at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Currently, the code is under an open-source initiative thanks to the support of some initial developers, who are presently spread around the world!
